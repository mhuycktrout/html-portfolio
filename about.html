        <hr />
        <p>I am a new Web Developer and I have a strong list of transeferable skills from my previous work experience that I believe will help me as I learn & grow.
            I am able to learn new skills quickly as well as hone&improve my skills through practice. I believe in consistent practice to improve. I have good interpersonal skills, I enjoy 
            being part of a team and doing my best to help reach our goal. I am a strong critical thinker and problem solver, I am often able to work through difficult subjects. If I do not understand a subject,
            then I will do my research to learn about the subject to achieve my goal.
