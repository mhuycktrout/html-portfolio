<h1>About Mitchell Man</h1>
<hr />
<p>I'm a simple man. I like food, dogs, plants, cars, sports, hanging out, irony, etc. 
  <br />
  <br />
  Also, trying to type out things about myself right now feels like when you had to stand up infront of the class and tell everyone a fun fact about yourself... <br />
  You think you know yourself until someone asks you to describe yourself and what you like to do.
  Then you're just left wondering who you really are.<br />
  <br />
  Anyways,<br />
  </p>

<p>Born at the ripe age of 0. I was automatically cast into a hard life by being the most awesome of my brothers.
   I grew up living a normal life like everyone else, playing sports and hanging with friends while trying to avoid doing homework and chores.
   After college, I got really into cooking for a while but ultimately decided that was not going to work out. 
   Then I found myself in a strange new world that I had never been in before, I was the only male worker in an office full of girls. 
    
</p>

<p>Now I had grown up with only brothers, had mostly guy friends and even working in the kitchen was a mostly male dominated industry, at least when I was there. 
    So I was in a brand new unfamiliar territory, feeling lost, confused and with a suspicion that I was brought in to kill any insects that may get into the office. 
    Two years, many dead bugs and one tissue regeneration therapy introduction to the practice later, I am learning how to become a Web Developer!<br />
    <br />
    Follow along with me as I become better and better at coding!<br />
