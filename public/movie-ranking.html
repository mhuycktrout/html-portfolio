<h1>The Best Movies According to Mitchell Man</h1>

<h2>Mitchell Mans Current Top3 Movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Deadpool</h3>
<p>This movie is great for many reasons, the first being how it broke the mold of superhero movies at the time. The second reason is that it has some top notch humor to go along with the great acting and screenplay. I'm honestly not 100% sure of what "Screenplay" means but it does sound cool.

<h3>Shrek</h3>
<p>I mean, do I really need to explain why this movie is so great?<br />
"That'll do Donkey, That'll do"
</p>
<h3>Indiana Jones and The Raiders of the Lost Ark</h3>
<p>Fantastic adventure movie that sets up a solid trilogy thats fun to watch. Honestly, movies from the 80s can be so great. As long as they aren't terrible. <br />
   Anyways I do love this movie and many others from the 80s&90s. <br />
